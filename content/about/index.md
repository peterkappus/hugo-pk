Born in London, raised in St. Louis MO, shaped in Boulder, Brooklyn, Seattle, and now back in London, I've had the privilege to help build a successful  [digital agency](http://designcommission.com/), a [research, analytics, trading, and reporting platform](https://www.credit-suisse.com/ch/en/investment-banking/global-markets/equities/credit-suisse-plus.html), a more [digital UK Government](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/) and a [better BBC](https://www.bbc.com/backstage/design-engineering). 

I've been a web developer, a project, programme, portfolio manager, flat-pack furniture-assembler, linux systems administrator, CTO, and coach.

Along the way, I've learned to value **diverse perspectives**, **experimentation**, and **strong relationships**. 

Using **lean/agile** practices, ultra-inclusive facilitation techniques (like **Liberating Structures**), and powerful goal setting frameworks (like **OKRs**) I help teams to consistently challenge the status quo and redefine their peak performance.

I've also been known to [make art](http://www.abstraktor.com) and [improvise on the piano](https://piano.peterkappus.com). I'd love to know what you're working on.

I've helped teams in banking, government, media, bio-tech, and more to adopt tools like lean/agile practices, DevOps/SRE, systems thinking, [Objectives & Key Results](/okr-consulting), [Liberating Structures](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/), and [Nonviolent Communication](/nvc) to reach (and redefine) their peak. I've built things using C++, HTML, JavaScript, Java, Ruby on Rails, Python, and even Perl back in the day. In fact, you're looking at [some of my code](/colophon) right now.
