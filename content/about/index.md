  <p style="line-height: 2.5rem"> For the past twenty years I've helped teams to get better at building digital products and have fun while they do it.</p>
</div>

I was born in **London** (UK), raised in St. Louis MO (USA) and lived in Denver, Boulder, Brooklyn, and Seattle, returning to London in 2009. I studied computer science and architecture, helped to build a successful [digital agency](http://designcommission.com/), a wireless web-enabled insulin pump, a Forex trading platform, social media data-mining tools, a more [digital UK Government](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/) and lately, lots of [OKR Coaching](/okr-consulting) and [Agile Coaching](/cv).

I've been a web developer, a project, programme, & portfolio manager, a floor-mopper, start-up furniture assembler, a linux systems administrator, a CTO, and more.

_I love helping teams to do the following:_

1. Get clear on what they're doing 
2. Get clear on why they're doing it
3. Get better at doing what they're doing
4. Enjoy the journey!

I've helped teams in banking, government, media, bio-tech, and more to adopt tools like lean/agile practices, DevOps/SRE, systems thinking, [Objectives & Key Results](/okr-consulting), [Liberating Structures](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/), and [Nonviolent Communication](/nvc) to reach (and redefine) their peak. I've built things using C++, HTML, JavaScript, Java, Ruby on Rails, Python, and even Perl back in the day. In fact, you're looking at [some of my code](/colophon) right now.

I'd love to know what you're working on, see if I can help and maybe talk about <a href="/art">art</a>, <a href="/music">music</a>, and culture.
