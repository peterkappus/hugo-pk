I’m super excited that I’ve been asked to join Ryan Panchadsaram & Elizabeth Dunne on their OKR podcast ["CFRs"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOcKKswivlc) (watch this space)! Elizabeth warned me that they like to ask all their guests about their [first OKRs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2uJWkt2NEs). I had to confess that mine were pretty geeky...

In mid 2015, I came across a couple of [blog posts](https://www.infoq.com/articles/agile-goals-okr/ ) [about OKRs](https://eleganthack.com/the-art-of-the-okr-redux/) and got excited. I was helping the UK’s [government digital service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/about/) to ask the treasury for [nearly £500m](https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/2015/12/08/digital-in-the-spending-review/) to continue its digital transformation work (making the UK the [world’s most digital government in 2016](https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/reports/un-e-government-survey-2016)) and I was looking for ways to help teams scope out their ambition. 

OKRs were a perfect fit.

By the end of 2015, I’d seen how OKRs could help teams to focus and reach for the stars. Now, I wanted to know how they could help me, personally. Like many folks, I’ve been known to set [New Year’s goals](/blog/my-morning-routine-january-2021-edition/) so when 2016 arrived, I jumped on the opportunity to set some personal OKRs.

My wife and I had recently moved, we had an energetic 3-year-old, and I’d been working...a lot. All of this had put a strain on our relationship, my friendships, my sleep, and my physical health. In short, life had room to improve.

## OKRs to the rescue...maybe?
I sat down one Saturday morning in early January with my trusty Sharpies and sticky notes and doodled (what felt like) some sensible OKRs. I carefully hand-wrote them on a sheet of thick paper (presentation matters...kinda!) which I hung up on the wall. 

Later I started doing [regular checkins](/blog/a-guide-to-okr-check-ins) and putting sticky notes on the side to track my progress (I hadn't, yet, started [measuring confidence](/blog/measure-confidence-not-progress)). Eventually, I developed a [simple tracking tool I made in Google Sheets](/blog/free-okr-tracking-templates) but sticky notes were a good start!

In early February 2016 my OKRs looked like this:

I did manage to salvage “date night” later in the quarter but still missed most of my targets (but OKRs are meant to be super aspirational, right?). The bigger issue that you eagle-eyed OKR aficionados will notice is that these key results were really [initiatives in disguise](https://www.peterkappus.com/blog/okrs-are-not-tactics/), giving me things to do (but not actually demonstrating that I had achieved the objective).

The other issue is that the objectives, themselves, used pretty weak & flabby language with words like “help” and “more” or “better”. They would’ve been more powerful if I’d rephrased them to say:

Dad will…

* Be an outstanding partner
* Take exceptional care of his health and wellbeing
* Nurture robust relationships with friends & family

I might have measured these by surveying my wife (uncool), surveying myself (I’ve done this, actually… and it works), and surveying my friends but, in this case, measuring how many times we hung out felt like proof enough.

## Keep at it!
Despite not "achieving" all of my key results, this was a powerful exercise. I realised that OKRs could be a useful tool for helping me to pursue personal goals that would actually improve my quality of life (even if I fell short). My wife and I started talking more about what would make life better. We started behaving differently... we got more sleep.

And over time I realised the importance of tracking confidence and creating key results that were actually results (not just tasks to have done).

If you're wondering how to get started with OKRs, and don't feel ready to experiment with your team(s), take a look at your personal circumstance, dig deep, write a few things down and try them out for a few months. If nothing else, it's a great reminder that a [thing worth doing is worth doing badly](https://www.chesterton.org/a-thing-worth-doing/) and [practice makes better](/blog/study-reflection-and-practice/).
