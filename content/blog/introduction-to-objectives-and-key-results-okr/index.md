For the past several years, much of my work has involved coaching teams (and organisations) to use **Objectives and Key Results** (OKR), a powerful goal-setting framework originally pioneered by [Andy Grove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove) at Intel in the 80s and now being used by hundreds of organisations including [Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/), Spotify, AirBnB, and LinkedIn. They drive focus and alignment and provide tremendous clarity around what activities are producing which results.

## Overview
In very simple terms, an OKR is simply a big inspiring **Objective** with a few **Key Results** (two or three) which will be used to measure progress against the objective. 

_For example:_

**Objective** This quarter we will create a product that our customers _love_.

**Key Results** 

We'll know we've done this because we will:

1. Achieve a Net Promoter Score of 9 out of 10
2. Reach 50,000 product activations
3. Get 10,000 new sign-ups via customer referral

This example gives us a clear inspiring objective and three ways to know we've hit it (for now). These might not be exactly the right results to prove we've created a product people love, but they give us something concrete to go after in **this quarter**. At the end of the quarter, we'll see how well we delivered these key results and determine if they're still the right things to go after. Adjust, and repeat... inspect and adapt.

According to Marissa Mayer, _every key result should contain a number_. Key Results should feel very ambitions with teams expecting to deliver about 50% at the start of the quarter. Achieving even 70% of a Key Result should feel like a huge success. Consistently hitting 100% means you're not pushing hard enough.

Teams should check in on their OKRs every week, primarily [measuring confidence over progress](/blog/measure-confidence-not-progress) and finally giving their OKRs a grade from 0 to 100% at the end of the quarter. 

OKRs, confidence scores, delivery scores, and lessons learned should be made public throughout the entire company. 

Low scores provide valuable data with which to refine future activities. Is a thing still valuable? Do we have the resources needed to deliver it in the way described?

## Traditional goal-setting
Traditional long-range planning and strategy whether for your business or the [former Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_for_the_national_economy_of_the_Soviet_Union), tends to be highly brittle, relying on several critical assumptions:

1. Every step and dependency can be mapped out in detail in advance
2. External conditions will remain fixed 
4. The plan will be mostly correct requiring only small adjustments <sup><a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/agile-goals-okr">1</a></sup> 

Traditional goals are set in silos, annually, without much data, reviewed in a relatively cursory fashion at the start of the year and not really followed up on or challenged until the end of the year. Too often, it's a box ticking exercise which, unsurprisingly, doesn't provide deep alignment or drive strong outcomes.


## Why use OKRs?
OKRs give you a platform for having difficult and productive conversations. If I'm building a nuclear submarine and you're climbing Mount Everest, we need to talk. OKRs make our goals clear and guarantee that we address mis-alignment.

They give you a way to be extremely ambitious in your goals and also razor-sharp on how you'll measure success. It clearly links your day-to-day activities with your top-level strategy by weaving your [BHAGs](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/bhag.html) and your [KPIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator) into a cohesive system with clear causes & effects. 

OKRs clarify for everyone what you're working on and why, as well as giving you an easy platform to declare what you're NOT working on.

In the early days of agile software development, it was quite radical to say "[working software is the primary measure of progress](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)". Not meetings held, or requirements drafted or features released. OKRs take this notion further by reminding us that delivering working software (or doing any other activity) is only relevant if it produces strong results for the organisation.
