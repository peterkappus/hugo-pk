Early in my career, when I was getting into "project management", I often felt confused and intimidated by all the terminology I heard people throwing around. I wished there was something simple to explain each term and how they fit together. This is my attempt to write such a thing. I've intentionally avoided "agile" specific words (for now) to focus on more general concepts. 

## Reflecting, and planning
**Work** is the process of turning **resources**  into **outcomes**.

Right **NOW** is where the work happens but you’re constantly looking back at what you did in the past. <!--This is usually called “reporting” (or “tracking”) and is a useful way to think about  and thinking about what you will do in the future.--> Sometimes looking back is called **tracking**, **reporting**, **reviewing**, **reflecting**, or **retrospecting**. The reason we look _back_ is usually to help predict the _future_. Looking forward is called **planning**. When we try to figure out how long a thing will take (AKA the **timeline** or **lead time**), or how much it will cost (the **budget**), we might call that an **estimate**. 

> An estimate is just a guess. Nothing more.

Both **resources** and **outcomes** will need to be **tracked** and **planned**, together.

Plans (and estimates) are just guesses and nothing more but the act of planning is still useful. It can protect us from optimism bias, help us to understand the challenges we’ll face, and encourage us to think through how we can respond to them. [Dwight D. Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower) once said _“plans are useless but planning is indispensable”._ 

The more often you reflect on the past, the easier it becomes to look forward, and the more quickly and accurately you can both predict future outcomes and respond to change in the present.

## Resources 
When it comes to resources, it’s better to talk about _“investment"_ than _“expenses”_. It will change your mindset as you look at using resources to create **valuable outcomes**. Creating value is sometimes called "_Return on Investment_" or ROI. Good ROI is usually the goal. Predicting ROI helps people decide whether they want to bother doing something or not. You can predict ROI at any scale... Years, months, days, hours, minutes. It's helpful to think about what you want to get from any investment no matter how small so that you can decide whether everything you do is a worthwhile use of your time and energy.

<!--That said, sometimes you're just trying things for the sake of trying things and you don't know what the outcome will be. It's a rare and wonderful thing to get to simply play. Take advantage of this and appreciate it fully whenever you get the chance. -->


> The past is _evidence_, the future is _potential_, the present is _the work_.

Resources are typically split into **people** (or "_human resources_") and **non-people** (or "_other costs_").

People are typically split into **permanent staff** who are expected to stay with an organisation for years and **interim staff** (or **contractors**) who are expected to stick around for days, weeks, or months (but sometimes stay much longer). Permanent staff should help you solve long term problems like bringing a product to market and supporting it indefinitely. Contractors are useful in solving specific short-term problems where it's impractical or inefficient to hire in those specialised skills permanently.

**Non-People** investments are varied and could include anything from software licenses, to doughnuts, rent, training, chairs, legal fees, post-it notes, or web hosting. **People** investment involves on-boarding, off-boarding, recruitment, re-deployment, training, communities of practice, pensions, other benefits, and career development.

By **“outcomes”** we mean: how the world will be different at some specific point in the future (sometimes called a **“deadline”** or **“delivery date”**) because of what we’re doing and planning now. We can plan and report on outcomes in various ways using, for example, [Objectives & Key Results](/blog/okrs) (OKRs), **Milestones**, or **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**. If an outcome is difficult to measure, it won’t help us much to determine if our actions are effective. 

The **cadence** (or frequency) of your planning, reporting, and delivery will depend on how heavy the process is, how useful it is to the people involved, and how rapidly your organisation and environment change.

> "Plans are useless but planning is indispensable." &mdash; Dwight D. Eisenhower

A **risk** is a thing that might happen and prevent us from delivering our target outcome (or realising our ROI). If some event happens then your outcomes will be affected in some specific way. You might write them down in a **risk register** which is really just a list of risks, how likely they are, how much damage they could do, and some ideas for **mitigating** this risk. **Risk mitigation** simply means making a risk _less likely_ to happen or _reducing the impact_ if it does happen.

When weighing mitigation strategies, it's helpful to figure out how much each option might cost, how much _additional risk_ each option might bring, and how much it will improve your **confidence** in reaching your goal. Risks should be associated to an outcome. Otherwise, don't bother. 

**Issues** are like risks but describe problems which have already happened or, we believe, are guaranteed to happen. We can try mitigating them in the same way that we do risks, but usually with slightly more urgency.

If we can't solve an issue or mitigate a risk on our own, then we need to **escalate** it. This usually means taking it to someone more senior with more power, autonomy, influence, or information than we have who would be able to do different things to help.

## Conclusion
This is a non-exhaustive list but should get you started. What other words and phrases are you hearing that haven't been included here? What things would you explain to someone just starting in the world of project/programme/portfolio delivery? [Let me know](/contact) and I'll edit this post to make it more useful. Thanks for reading!
