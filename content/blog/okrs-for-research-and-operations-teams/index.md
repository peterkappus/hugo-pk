Teams doing scientific research or operational support often struggle to adopt OKRs. The researchers say "How can we predict when we will make some discovery?" and the operations teams say "We don't know what's going to happen in 3 days, let alone in 3 months!"

In this situation 

## Research teams:

 - Don't try to predict what breakthrough you'll make or when it will happen
 - Do commit to improving how you make any breakthrough

## Operations teams:
 - Don't try to predict what issues will require your attention 
 - Do commit to improving how you solve any issue
