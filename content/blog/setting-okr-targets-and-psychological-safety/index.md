## What is "psychological safety"?

At work (or anywhere for that matter), [Psychological safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety) is critical to allowing people to do their best, to learn and support each other, and (quite often) to prevent catastrophe. It's what allows people to be free from fear, shame, and guilt so that they speak up, ask difficult questions, and try new things. 

In times of great upheaval and transition (hi there, 2020!), psychological safety is vital to the survival of any organisation, social construct, or relationship. [Amy Edmondson](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6451) has written a [whole book](https://fearlessorganization.com/) on the topic and gave [this short talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhoLuui9gX8) if you’d like a primer.

## Success at 60%

I bring up psychological safety because someone recently asked me if I agreed with Rick Klau’s statement about setting OKR targets from his, now “classic” (perhaps infamous) 2012 [talk about OKRs at Google](https://library.gv.com/how-google-sets-goals-okrs-a1f69b0b72c7) in which he says “[Your target should be a 0.6 to 0.7 on a zero to one scale. If you consistently get ones, your not ‘crushing it’ you’re sandbagging.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJB83EZtAjc&feature=emb_title&t=27m48s)” Do I agree that we should be setting OKR targets that are so ambitious we would be lucky to achieve even 60%? 

*I love this question.*

I love it because it shows how something seemingly simple (levels of ambition for OKR targets) exposes something so fundamental to how different organisations operate. It speaks to the core of what makes some organisations truly exceptional workplaces where people grow and deliver outstanding results and what makes other organisations mediocre performers and potentially miserable places to work.

## What are OKR targets, anyway?
I’ve written previously about [setting good OKRs](https://www.peterkappus.com/blog/running-an-okr-setting-workshop/). A quick refresher: when we talk about setting good OKR targets, we’re talking about the “pointy” end of our OKRs. The "businessy, mathematical" end, if you like.

Our **Objectives** should be big and daring, broad and inspiring:

* [Eradicate Extreme Poverty](https://www.one.org/)
* [Crush the competition](https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-50-8086-operation-crush/)

The **Key Results**, in contrast, are highly concrete, easily measurable outcomes that we’ll use to prove we’ve reached our Objective. Key Results should be [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) with specific, quantitative targets to reach in a specific timeframe (e.g. a calendar quarter): 

* Lift 500k people above the poverty line
* Increase quarterly revenue 40%

Even more important than the scope of the outcome ("the target") is whether we genuinely care about this outcome and want to be asked about it every week for the rest of the quarter. Is this really one of the “key results” by which we should evaluate all our efforts towards a single objective?

## How much is enough?

Assuming we’ve managed to pick Key Results which really resonate, how ambitious should they be? Should we set them so high that we’re lucky if we hit even 60%? Is 60% the benchmark of success?

My answer of how ambitiously to set OKR targets is… **it depends**. 

When you first start going to the gym, giving up meat, doing yoga, etc. The most important thing is to know your _edge_ and how far you can push yourself without injury or burn-out. OKRs are an opportunity to put your organisation under the microscope and understand your own comfort threshold. If you have the luxury of working in an organisation with a high degree of psychological safety, where constructive failure is celebrated as an opportunity to learn and grow, where leaders admit their weaknesses and invite criticism, and where curiosity wins out over blame, then you should feel quite comfortable setting highly ambitious (maybe even unreachable) targets. 

Spoiler alert: most organisations don’t work this way. Yours probably doesn’t, even if you think it does.

As Dr. Edmondson says in the video above, nobody shows up to work wanting to look “[Ignorant, Incompetent, Intrusive, or Negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhoLuui9gX8&t=1m40s)”. We want to be seen as capable, positive, and consistently delivering on our commitments. In some organisations, this is a matter of survival. 

> Most organisations don’t work this way. Yours probably doesn’t.


 [Writing in 2003](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8150380_A_Typology_of_Organisational_Cultures), sociologist Ron Westrum identified three primary organisational types:  Pathological, Bureaucratic, and Generative. Pathological organisations are marked by low coöperation, low responsibility, "blamestorming", and non-existant innovation. Generative organisations are marked by high coöperation, learning from mistakes, and implementing novel approaches.
 
There is almost always a degree of pressure (whether motivated by politics, team dynamics, or personal pride) to be "predictable" and "deliver on our commitments". While delivering on the big picture is important, we often miss the forest for the trees. 

The thing is, every big innovation involves failure along the way. Thomas Edison famously tried thousands of different materials before landing on a filament of tungsten. Between 2008 and 2010 the Google Chrome team repeatedly set (and failed to achieve) audacious stretch goals for weekly active users starting at 20 million and eventually achieving 111 million weekly active users.<sup>1</sup>

> I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work. <br> – Thomas Edison

## What to do?

If you're in a pathological or bureaucratic organisation, you probably shouldn't be using OKRs. But odds are, your organisation thinks OKRs can help, and maybe they can...

The good news is that if you're adopting OKRs in an organisation with low psychological safety where results need to be delivered at or near 100%, you can scale your ambition accordingly.

Imagine that you have a big "dial" next to your Key Result targets. In an ideal world, you'd start with 50/50 confidence. In other words, you'd pick targets which get you "uncomfortably excited" (to quote Larry Page)<sup>1</sup>. In your world, **you might have to dial down your ambition** so that you can get closer to 100% and manage the optics around what you can do. Maybe it's not a 40% increase in revenue, but a 25% increase...or less.

## Wait, what?! 

I know: I'm telling you to ignore all the OKR literature out there, even John Doerr, himself... but above all, I'm a pragmatist. 

If people are being pushed too hard to "aim high" and "be ambitious" and it becomes a question of losing face in a scary environment, people will either reject OKRs outright (which can be addressed) or pick Key Results that don't actually matter and just pay lip service to the practice while it slowly dies on the vine and gives the organisation no benefit, while stifling future innovation by eroding trust in leadership and further willingness to try new things.

## What about OKR grading?

In addition to scaling ambition to fit a bit more in the "comfort zone", the other important piece of behaviour is what happens during the grading process. This is where leaders can truly flex the power of OKRs and use the opportunity to create greater safety.

Amy Edmondson gives 3 simple ways to improve psychological safety:

1. Frame the work as a learning problem, not an execution problem
2. Acknowledge your own fallibility
3. Model curiosity (ask lots of questions which creates a necessity for ‘voice’)

How does this look in the context of grading OKRs?

1. Remember that every OKR is a scientific experiment, not a task to complete.
2. Be ambitious in your own goals and celebrate when you come up short and learn something in the process
3. Ask powerful questions. Where were we unlucky vs unskilled? What didn't work? What will we do differently? 

In this way, we use OKRs to explore and understand reality, not to control it. It strengthens our foundations and operating position, ultimately enabling far greater outcomes.

## Keep your eyes on the prize

Ideally, teams would model this behaviour across the entire organisation. If not, you may find yourself acting as a team which appears to deliver less than the other teams but which has far more challenging goals. Tread carefully, work closely with other teams and make sure you're ready to be a trailblazer.

As Ken Schwaber says "[A dead sheepdog is a useless sheepdog.](https://littlecode.in/2019/07/30/a-dead-scrum-master-is-a-useless-scrum-master-ken-schwaber/#:~:text=A%20DEAD%20Scrum%20Master%20is%20a%20USELESS%20Scrum%20Master%20%E2%80%93%20Ken%20Schwaber,-In%20Ken%20Schwaber's&text=Remember%20that%20Scrum%20is%20the,%E2%80%9C)". Like anything transformative, adopting OKRs requires great sensitivity. The most important thing you can do while adopting OKRs is to understand reality. Used well, OKRs are the most powerful tool there is for understanding how your organisation works, how the environment around your organisation works and where you have the greatest leverage for change.

In other words, know your audience, don't torch  your OKR implementation by insisting that people move too far out of their comfort zone. Be patient. Remember that OKRs are there to serve your organisation in the most holistic sense. OKRs should enhance psychological safety. It will vary for every team and individual but find your edge, figure out exactly how far to push, and, above all, be sensitive.
