<small>DRAFT - This post is still being drafted and probably needs more work. You can make comments [here](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/A-guide-to-OKR-check-ins--AabPYQ6H9041XaAcFBVzKEo6Ag-PcNgGH7da8TkWiAAPj3ww) or [contact me](/contact). Thanks for your suggestions!</small>

While [setting your Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)](/blog/running-an-okr-setting-workshop) can feel like a daunting task on its own, the real value of OKRs comes through regular check-ins. This is where you get to see how your day-to-day work is impacting your **Key Results** or, more accurately, _your confidence_ in delivering those key results.

## A quick overview (for the impatient)
Want some basic steps to get you started? Look no further...

1. Nominate an "**OKR Champion**" to facilitate the check-ins. Rotate this role.
2. Check in with the team every week
2. Check in with the team every week :wink: (even if not everybody can attend)
3. For each key result:
  1. Review last week's confidence, narrative, and actions
  2. Measure current confidence with a quick [fist-to-five vote](#f2f)
  1. Hear from the high and low voters
  1. Re-vote for greater consensus (optional)
  1. Brainstorm actions to improve confidence
2.  [Record this info](/blog/free-okr-tracking-templates) and share it widely

Expect your first check-in to take about an hour and feel pretty awkward; the second should take around 30 minutes and feel more useful. Aim to get check-ins down to around 15 minutes.

## Check-ins are the most important part of OKRs
OKR check-ins (like OKRs themselves) should be light-weight, informative, and actionable. Like daily stand-ups, good OKR check-ins should:

- identify issues
- propose solutions and next actions
- unify the team
- connect actions to outcomes
- strengthen ownership and accountability
- celebrate incremental wins 
- create powerful momentum


## Setting up for success
As with any new habit, doing regular OKR check-ins requires gentle, constant pressure, and strong team commitment. With practice, check-ins will become a quick, painless, and valuable activity.

Every team should have an OKR champion who, a bit like the [Speaker of the House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_(United_Kingdom)), facilitates the discussion, captures the outputs, and ensures OKRs are working hard for the team. Usually a project/delivery manager will start in this role (inviting the team to a weekly recurring check-in meeting) and then hand over to different people throughout the quarter. This  gives others valuable experience and helps share the load. Try letting the current OKR Champion nominate the next one each week. The weekly check-in can happen any time. Some teams like to use it to kick off the week, or wrap it up, or put it in the middle when there are fewer other meetings. See what feels right to your team.

> Like any new habit, OKR check-ins will feel cumbersome at first. Persist and they'll get easier and more valuable.

## Measure confidence (not progress)
Remember, [OKRs are not tactics](/blog/okrs-are-not-tactics). **They're not a roadmap or a plan.** They describe the _change_ you want to see _because of whatever you end up doing_, but not the activities themselves. For me, this is the key differentiator between OKRs and traditional goal-setting. Check-ins accentuate this distinction. 

I believe it's more useful to [report on confidence rather than progress](/blog/measure-confidence-not-progress). Progress on key results should be expressible a simple number. Discussing confidence invites team members to get into the _why_ behind the number. If you need a long interesting discussion about progress, your key result probably isn't measurable enough.

## Vote with the "fist-to-five"
I first read about the fist-to-five in the handy [Spotify retro kit](https://labs.spotify.com/2017/12/15/spotify-retro-kit/). It's a terrific, easy, way to get instant feedback from a group on almost any topic. 

I start by reading aloud the **objectives**. Then for each **Key Result**, I ask "On a scale of zero to five, how confident are you that we'll deliver this key result?" I count down from three and then each team member holds up some number of fingers with a fist to show no confidence and an open palm to show 100% confidence. This is a gut reaction, not a precise scientific measurement. <!--Sometimes we incorporate partial fingers or get into a brief debate on [correct finger-counting etiquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger-counting). :grin: So long as it doesn't slow us down, I encourage anything to make the vote more fun and informative!-->

Once we've voted, I'll ask the person with _highest_ confidence to explain their confidence rationale. Then I'll ask the same from the _least confident_ person. A short discussion may follow. Based on this, we may vote again to see if consensus improves. Once we have a rough consensus (or even if we don't), the current OKR Champion will pick a number that the group can live with and write it down.

## Pick some next actions
Measuring confidence isn't particularly valuable on its own. If we've picked difficult key results (which, of course, we have! :smile:) then sooner or later, our confidence will dip. This doesn't feel great, but it's a natural part of doing hard things.

Whatever our confidence vote, it's critical to then ask the team what things we can do to improve our confidence in the next week. This is where the team's greatest value lies and the real power of OKRs. **No one is better positioned to decide what to do next.** Quickly brainstorm options and pick one or two which can be owned by a team member. **Write them down and do them this week.** 

> Check-ins close the loop between ideas, actions, confidence, and outcomes.

The best part about picking these actions comes the following week after they've been done: when teams get to vote again and see how much confidence has improved. I've done this with multiple teams and once they've seen how checking-in leads to constructive actions and how performing those actions improves confidence, they look forward to repeating the cycle as often as possible. **It's an in incredible feeling and a vital boost when taking on difficult goals.** 

## The struggle is real. Share it!
Repeat this process for each key result and each objective. Capture the confidence, narrative, and next actions in a [spreadsheet or tool](/blog/free-okr-tracking-templates). Share the results with everyone on the team or everyone in your organisation. I've used Google sheets before and published the results as a (non-spiderable :spider:) web page which can be shared with a wider audience (stakeholders and other teams). Sharing the weekly report is critical because it shows everyone
- what's working
- where we're still struggling and need help
- what we want to do next
- How likely we are to deliver our Key Results
- You're not alone! This stuff is hard and we're all in it together!

## Common check-in problems
### We don't like our OKRs, anymore!
Sometimes your OKRs look great at the end of an [OKR-setting session](/blog/running-an-okr-setting-workshop) but once you actually start checking-in, you discover all sorts of flaws and wish you'd defined them differently. This is just fine, and it's why I recommend teams start checking in as soon as possible even while the OKRs are still in draft form. If it's within the first few weeks of the quarter, feel free to change and adjust those OKRs. If you're half-way through, think carefully about why these issues are only now coming to light. Is it a problem with the OKRs or some dependency that we didn't see before? Is it more valuable, now, to change the OKRs in question, drop them, or continue and see what lessons we can learn? Whatever you decide, do it as a team and get as much value from the experience as possible.


### We can't get consensus!
If the team frequently struggles to get consensus around confidence and next actions or the discussion simply requires too much time, this is usually a sign that you have **too many OKRs** (stick with 1 or two per team per quarter with 1-3 key results each), or they're **not measurable** enough, or they're dependent on **different activities being done by different specialists**. This may mean you're not actually in a cross-functional team. You may be in [a work group.](https://dzone.com/articles/workgroups-vs-teams). 
This happens when you're dependent on individuals with special knowledge to realise an outcome. 
OKRs are great at exposing this kind of dysfunction/opportunity. It can be scary because it often requires changing how the team is organised and how it thinks about work and success (which may mean rewriting your OKRs) but it's extremely valuable and can lead to much stronger outcomes. **Don't ignore this!**

### We already have too many meetings!
Yes... it sounds like YAM (yet another meeting) to have every week, but with practice, the OKR check-in can replace your other weekly status meeting(s) or at least augment them. Many teams have reported that starting their weekly progress meeting with an OKR check-in has made the meetings much more productive. Some have even stopped doing longer meetings as the 15 min OKR check-in does everything needed to keep them on track. Remember, your OKRs are the most important reflection of what you're doing with your time in this quarter. 

What else is there to talk about?  :wink:


## Keep at it!
I've seen many teams set OKRs but fail to check-in and then give up on OKRs entirely thinking that they don't provide any real value. I've seen other teams set ambitious OKRs, begin checking in (when it felt awkward and difficult), then keep going, continue checking-in and sharing results, and, eventually, get to a point where the OKRs check-ins became a vital tool for identify issues, brainstorming and taking ownership of solutions, ultimately, enabling them to deliver outcomes that previously seemed impossible.

How are you checking in on your OKRs? I'd love to [hear from you](/contact).
