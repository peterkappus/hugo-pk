## A quick guide for the impatient
These steps will get you a long way towards doing useful check-ins. 

1. Check in every week
2. Check in every week :wink: (even if not everybody can attend)
3. For each key result:
  1. Measure confidence with a quick [fist-to-five vote](#f2f)
  1. Hear from the high and low voters
  1. Optional: vote again for more consensus
  1. Brainstorm actions to improve confidence
  2. [Capture shared narrative, confidence, and actions](/blog/free-okr-tracking-templates)
1. Repeat for each KR
2. Record this and share with EVERYBODY

It may be enough to simply start doing the above on a regular (I recommend weekly) basis. It helps to have a dedicated wrangler and strong commitment from the team to drive the process and ensure it happens regularly. With practice they will get faster and more useful. 

For more thoughts on how and why to check-in on your OKRs, keep reading...

## Check-ins are the most important part of OKRs

While [setting your Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)](/blog/running-an-okr-setting-workshop) can feel like a Herculean feat on its own, recurring check-ins are where the true value of OKRs gets realised. They're where you get to see how your day-to-day work is impacting your **Key Results** or, more accurately, _your confidence_ in delivering those key results.

Check-ins (like OKRs) are meant to be a light-weight way of setting goals, enhancing communication, measuring, and adjusting to achieve better outcomes. Like a good daily stand-up, a good OKR check-in rapidly accomplishes the following:

- identifies major issues
- proposes solutions and next actions
- unifies the team
- connects actions to outcomes
- encourages ownership and accountability
- celebrates incremental wins 
- creates powerful momentum


## Setting up for success
As with any new habit, doing regular OKR check-ins requires gentle, constant pressure, and agreement from the team to make it happen. With practice, check-ins will become faster, easier, and (eventually) a valuable activity that the teams will look forward to doing.

A bit like the [Speaker of the House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_(United_Kingdom)), every team should have an OKR champion who invests in understanding and facilitating the process, guides discussions, helps answer questions, and ensures OKRs are working hard for the team. Usually a project/delivery manager will start in this role and it's nice to rotate throughout the quarter to give others experience and share the burden of wrangling everyone. Let the current OKR Champion nominate the next person. The initial OKR Champion invites the team to a recurring weekly check-in session. The first time you check-in, expect it to take an hour, the next time 30 minutes until, finally, you can do it consistently in under 15 minutes. Some teams like to do this at the start of their week or as part of other weekly planning meetings. Others do it in the middle or the end. See what feels right to your team.

> Like any new habit, OKR check-ins take practice. Eventually you should be able to do it in under 15min per week.

## Measure confidence (not progress)
Remember, [OKRs are not tactics](/blog/okrs-are-not-tactics). **They're not a roadmap or a plan**. They describe the _change_ you want to see _because of whatever you end up doing_, but not the activities themselves. For me, this is the key differentiator between OKRs and traditional goal-setting and where the true power of check-ins comes to light. 

I believe it's more useful to [report on confidence rather than progress](/blog/measure-confidence-not-progress). Progress on key results should be expressible a simple number. Discussing confidence invites team members to get into the _why_ behind the number. If you need a long interesting discussion about progress, your key result probably isn't measurable enough.

## Vote with the "fist-to-five"
I first read about the fist-to-five in the handy [Spotify retro kit](https://labs.spotify.com/2017/12/15/spotify-retro-kit/). It's a terrific, easy, way to get instant feedback on almost any topic in a team setting. 

I start by reading aloud the **objectives** (which are hopefully not too numerous). For each **Key Result**, I ask "On a scale of zero to five, how confident are you that we'll deliver this key result?" Each team member holds up the appropriate number of fingers using a fist to show no confidence, a five fingered open palm for 100% confidence, or somewhere in between. Sometimes we use partial fingers, more than 5 if we're really confident or get into a brief debate on [correct finger-counting etiquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger-counting). :grin: So long as it doesn't slow us down, I encourage anything to make the vote more fun and informative!

Once we've voted, I'll ask the person with _highest_ confidence for a bit of narrative: what happened since the last vote to make them feel this way? Then I'll ask the same from the _least confident_ person. A short discussion may follow. Based on this, we may vote again to see if consensus improves. Once we have consensus (or even if we don't), I (or the OKR Champion) will pick a number and write it down.

## Pick some next actions
Measuring confidence isn't particularly valuable on it's own. If we've picked difficult key results (which, of course, we have! :smile:) then sooner or later, our confidence will dip which doesn't feel terrific.

Whatever our confidence level, it's empowering and important to ask the team what small things we can do to improve that confidence in the next week. This is where the team's greatest value lies and the real power of OKRs. The team is best positioned to figure out what to do next. Better than a customer, a boss, or anyone outside the team. We may go somewhere for advice, but deciding to get that advice is a decision in the team. We may need to send an email, follow up with someone, do a bit of research, have a more in-depth discussion... whatever! Quickly brainstorm options and pick one or two which people are willing to own and write them down. This may even impact our sprint goals or other delivery activities. Ideally they are things which can be done within a week.

> Check-ins close the loop between ideas, actions, confidence, and outcomes.

The best part about picking these actions is the following week (after they're done) when teams get to measure and see how much confidence has improved. I've done this with multiple teams and once they've seen how checking-in leads to constructive actions and how performing those actions improves confidence, they look forward to repeating the cycle as often as possible. **It's an in incredible feeling a vital boost when taking on difficult goals.** 

## The struggle is real. Share it!
Repeat this process for each key result and each objective. Capture the confidence, narrative, and next actions in a [spreadsheet or tool](/blog/free-okr-tracking-templates). Share the results with everyone on the team or everyone in your organisation. I've used Google sheets before and published the results as a (non-spiderable :spider:) web page which can be sent to a wider audience. Sharing the weekly report is critical because it shows other teams 
- what's working
- where we're still struggling and need help
- what we want to do next
- How likely we are to deliver our Key Results
- They're not alone! This stuff is hard and we're all in it together!

## Common check-in problems
### We can't get consensus!
If you're consistently struggling to get consensus around confidence scores and next actions or it simply requires too much discussion, this is usually a sign that  you have **too many OKRs** (stick with 1 or two per team per quarter with 1-3 key results each), or they're **not measurable** enough, or they're dependent on **different activities being done by different specialists**. This may mean you're not actually in a cross-functional team. You may be in [a work group.](https://dzone.com/articles/workgroups-vs-teams). 
This happens when you're dependent on individuals with special knowledge to realise an outcome. 
OKRs are great at exposing this kind of dysfunction/opportunity. It can be scary because it often requires changing how the team is organised and how it thinks about work and success (which may mean rewriting your OKRs) but it's extremely valuable and can lead to much stronger outcomes. **Don't ignore this!**

### We already have too many meetings!
Yes... it sounds like YAM (yet another meeting) to have every week, but with practice, the OKR check-in can replace your other weekly status meeting(s) or at least augment them. Many teams have reported that starting their weekly progress meeting with an OKR check-in has made the meetings much more productive. Some have even stopped doing longer meetings as the 15 min OKR check-in does everything needed to keep them on track. Remember, your OKRs are the most important reflection of what you're doing with your time in this quarter. 
  
  What else is there to talk about?  :wink:


## Keep at it!
I've seen many teams set OKRs but fail to check-in and then give up on OKRs entirely thinking that they don't provide any benefit.
