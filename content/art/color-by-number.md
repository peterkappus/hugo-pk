My friend, the photographer and painter <a href="http://www.angelahillmathdetective.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.angelahillmathdetective.com']);">Angela Hill</a> has synesthesia, meaning that she has a strong association between colors and numbers: eg. 1 = white, 2 = yellow, etc. Using the color palette informed by her synesthesia, I've created several pieces around math and color. Color by Number: Pi depicts the mathematical constant, pi.
