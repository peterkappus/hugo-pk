# CV Stuff
My CV has taken many forms over the years and has become quite adaptable based on the role I'm pursuing. I'm using this doc as a place to store skills and profile copy to be plugged in or revisited as needed. It won't make much sense in this current state. **TODO**: Rationalise this list and focus on my current OKR niche.

## Profile


### Developer Advocate
A versatile, innovative, programme/portfolio delivery manager, agile/OKR coach, and engineering advocate, with a natural servant-leader approach, I bring  <!-- and <b>certified scrum master</b> --> strong technical and data skills, a passion for creative problem-solving, and 20+ years of experience <!--delivering value for a range of organisations--> spanning financial services, media, government, and more.

### Craft coach

A versatile, innovative, delivery and code-as-craft coach, I've spent the past 20 years helping technology teams to excel at what they do.

I've helped teams to break apart legacy monoliths into modern high-performing applications. In the process, we've migrated their codebases to modern toolchains, improved their branching and merging strategies to streamline their workflows and automated everything in their control to reduce build times from days to minutes.

I've invited teams to explore BDD & TDD to speed up regression testing and prevent gold-plating. I've introduced pairing and peer reviews (with Pull Requests), code-jams, and mob-programming to build shared understanding and enhance skills across entire teams. 

Finally, I have a strong foundation in Agile Coaching and UX/Service Design principles. Improvement is a continuous journey. I look forward to exploring it with you and helping to ensure that your teams not only build the right thing, they build the thing right. 


## Strategist
A data-savvy, highly technical digital strategist with a passion for service delivery, organisational transformation, and problem-solving spanning nearly twenty years of experience across a diverse range of industries including government, banking/financial services, media/publishing, and bio-tech.

My strong goal-setting and strategic alignment skills (e.g. OKRs) combined with a relentless focus on commercial outcomes and financial responsibility (looking after budgets in excess of Â£150m) ensure outstanding results and highly engaged teams.

I'm happy to roll up my sleeves and build my own tools or try new technologies and ways of working. I create strong internal communities of practice and nurture lasting positive change while rapidly understanding and delivering to the broader organisational context and strategy.

I combine deep technical understanding with excellent communication and leadership skills to <!--work with both in-house teams and external vendors locally and globally to deliver best-of-breed digital products which delight customers and help clients to succeed.
